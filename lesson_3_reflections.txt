When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working on a big project with other people so that all the work
    is stored on the cloud which is more safe in case my laptop/pc gets stolen
    or has a problem. I can also access the project from anywhere as long as I
    have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reason that when working on a program I want to save my
	progress manually so I can avoid weird and unstable versions of the
	program since I know better when the amount of work I did is relevant
	and good to go.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are "clones" of a repository on GitHub on my own repository giving
	the author credit and letting me make any updates to the repository without
	needing permission. Clones are copies of a repository on my local machine so
	that I can edit the project on my own editors. Branches are commits on the
	same repository that may be used either for debugging purposes or experimental
	changes and are different than the main (master) branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
