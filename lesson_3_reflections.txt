When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working on a big project with other people so that all the work
    is stored on the cloud which is more safe in case my laptop/pc gets stolen
    or has a problem. I can also access the project from anywhere as long as I
    have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reason that when working on a program I want to save my
	progress manually so I can avoid weird and unstable versions of the
	program since I know better when the amount of work I did is relevant
	and good to go.
